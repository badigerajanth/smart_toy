# smart_toy
A toy which has an motor driver ic and circuitry and an rf module for wireless control of the toy  to mae it an smart toy.
I added an ESP32 to control the toy via wifi which can be controlled by an app for now to remotely controlling via internet from anywhere,
I'm using Blynk server and its application as an controller.
i decoded the the motor driver IC and gave the signals to that IC from esp32 by writing the code and ESP32 was connected to the internet from WIFI.
So it can be controlled from anywhere.
